Activity stack:


Features/issues priority:

High:
hard - nested selectors
easy - dont allow selecting ourselves / selectorgadget controls

Medium:
hard - rework styles into something sensible
hard - visual intuitive expression editor:
    full element(s) path shown, clicking on parents, their classes, id's and other attributes to include inside expression
easy - highlight html and json inside data control tab
easy - animate body scroll on field/control-tabs overlap (Velocity can't handle scrollTop)
medium - highlight target element when hovered over in a .data.many control tab
medium - persist sidebar between clicks (storage (problematic since storage is accessed from iframe))
JS toggling:
    medium - enabling would be by saving state, reloading tab and then extension (from state stashed in sessionStorage?)
    hard - simply dumping HTML into document.documentElement.innerHTML does not cover:
        on* attribute events
        "javascript:" links
        currently present javascript
The whole thing with persisting sidebar and js toggling in a bookmarklet like environment is very wonky:
    hard - switch to proper extension format for both chrome and firefox, content-script can still run js when it's disabled on the tab
    medium - port to firefox
        firefox doe not have sandbox directive, but we can use "content_security_policy": "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'; object-src 'self'"
        (or possibly sandbox also inside csp?) to run vuejs
Implement testing capabilities:
    medium - sweep over selected templates downloading and testing them on their respective pages
    medium - allow to specify and edit template matching pages
    medium - implement some sorta contracts to verify templates
medium - some kinda way to let specify target attribute

Low:
hard - tweak styles for firefox
hard - fix styles for firefox gtk build
easy - "show hidden elements" button (use jq ":hidden" selector maybe)
hard - "highlight all" mode - highlights all elements on the page using different color for each respective field
    hard - also draw field titles written on top of highlight area
