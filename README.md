# ScrapeMate Beta ![GitHub Logo](/icons/24.png) 
Scraping assistant tool. Editing and maintaining CSS/XPath selectors across webpages.  
Available as a chrome extension or you can also try a [bookmarklet mode](https://rawgit.com/Unknowny/ScrapeMate/master/index.html).  
Built on top of the [SelectorGadget](https://github.com/cantino/selectorgadget).  

Quick way to pick and maintain CSS/XPath selectors and their presets for external use: website testing or scraping.  
Features include:
* Element picker (from SelectorGadget).
* Preset JSON editor (convenient for use in conjunction with scrapy or any similar tools).
* List of presets ever worked on.
* Quick preview of the data currently selected.
* Disabling page JavaScript (experimental, feature is being worked on).
* Planned features: [TODO](/TODO)

### Note
Bookmarklet mode will not work on many pages (CSP enabled ones).  
You can also install this in chrome development mode as an unpacked extension by just pointing it to the cloned repository directory.
